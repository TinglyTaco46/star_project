For the approach I took was to first make sure that the api I used was working and was able to pull the data that I needed 
Once that was finised I wasnted to add and style the imgages that I wanted 
After I got all this my next step was to animate it
Once my css and animation were done I went back into my javascript too change my method giving the images and evventlistneer and a modal to display the information when the picture was click on. 
My next step was to push it through netlify so I can find any errors in my codes.

So far the unsolved problem I have is being able to get more than one api working and within the array of objects link the other Api's so it cant display that infomation as well rather than just the one array of objects
